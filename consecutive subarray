Given an array and a target number, find the number of consecutive arrays that can be diveded by a target number k.
I made two mistakes when dealing with this problem.
1)We allow duplicate here. 1,2,3.....1,2,3... both 1,2,3 should be counted here
2)consecutive...I thought it has to be 1,2,3, and 1,2,4 is not allowed. No, just consecutive.

A natural thought would to count every subset, that would be o(n2). A tricky way would be use Mod. Use a hashmap to record

public int helper(int k, int[] a){
  Map<Integer,Integer>=new HashMap<>();
  int sum=0;
  for(int i=0;i<a.length;i++){
    sum+=a[i];
    int r=sum%k;
    if(map.containsKey(r)) {
      int temp=map.get(r);
      map.put(r,temp+1);
    }
    else map.put(r,1);
  }
  
  
}
